# Anindya's dotfiles
My config files on Arch Linux, but most settings should work on any Linux distro.

Currently contains dotfiles for
* Bash (and Readline)
* Git
* R
* Tmux
* Vim (and Vim's templates)

Also, contains handy shell scripts for
* Checking my laptop's battery status
* Compiling my notes
* Checking whether my dotfiles are up-to-date
