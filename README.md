# Anindya's dotfiles

My config files on Arch Linux, but most settings should work on any Linux distro. Ubuntu is on the 'ubuntu' branch of this repo

I live in the vim/tmux/i3 'meme', and most of my command shortcuts are based on never leaving the home row.

Also, contains handy shell scripts for
* Compiling my notes
* Checking whether my dotfiles are up-to-date
* Simple status functions like battery, internet, status lines, CPU usage etc

Some aspects of i3 are Work in Progress because I have only recently given up Gnome for the more customisable window manager approach.

Thanks so much to LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch for Neovim setup!
