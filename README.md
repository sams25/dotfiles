# Anindya's dotfiles
My config files on Arch Linux, but most settings should work on any Linux distro
I live in the vim/tmux/i3 'meme'.

Currently contains dotfiles for
* Bash (and Readline)
* Git
* R
* Tmux
* Vim (and Vim's templates)

Also, contains handy shell scripts for
* Compiling my notes
* Checking whether my dotfiles are up-to-date
* Simple status functions like battery, internet, status lines, CPU usage etc
