* Vim spellcheck disappears when it changes from .tex to .latex
* Come up with a list of default R packages - ensure they can install
* remove xorg_config and put that into i3 config
* something results in 'usr/lib/Xorg -nolisten tcp' eating up loads of CPU time -
  disable that - it might be i3bar?
